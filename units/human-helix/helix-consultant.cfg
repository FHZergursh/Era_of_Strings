    description= _ "Consultants are the junior field agents of the Double Helix Guild, usually the first people brought in when something doesn't quite go to plan. Most of the time, potential issues fizzle out on their own, or can be solved with a small donation of cash, owing much to their namesake as pencil pushers. In the event they must intervene and eliminate a threat, Consultants may make use of their daggers and poisons, though they usually prefer hiring others to do their dirty work, most often Sweepers or corrupt National Guardsmen."
