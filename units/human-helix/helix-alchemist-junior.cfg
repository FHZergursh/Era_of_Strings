    description= _ "Alchemists are a secretive bunch, and they select their apprentices with care. Those lucky enough to be invited to join the Double Helix Guild are priviliged to learn those secrets and become Junior Alchemists, now serving at the forefront of medical research and human augmentation under more senior instructors. Defending themselves with a blade hidden in their canes, they are expected to take the secrets they learn to the grave, should it be necessary. Junior Alchemists, outside of the few most gifted exceptions, are expected to stay Junior for at least three years before earning their freedom."
