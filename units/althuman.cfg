<header>text='Government'</header>
The people of Victrus are lead by an Emperor, a single person (almost always male) that rules Victrus until their death. When an Emperor dies, a week of mourning is held in their name and their body is entombed beneath the royal palace. Selecting a new Emperor is wholly the decision of the Chief Royal Advisor, a highly influencial individual chosen by the prior Emperor to coordinate all matters of the royal court (including the addition of new members) and handle governence in their stead when necessary. As the position is so powerful in shaping the future of the country, many of the Guilds fight hard to get their prefered candidate chosen, though ultimately, whoever gets picked is up to the whims of the Emperor. The current Emperor is His Majesty Emperor Charles (The Stern) of Lindenthorpe, third of his name, Bringer of Affluence, Defender of Mankind and Sovereign of Divinity. For anyone outside of the courts, Emperor Charles the Third works just fine.  
<header>text='The Guilds'</header>
The Guilds of Victrus are the primary faciliators of the explosive growth of industry within Victrus, with many of the day to day operations of the Empire falling to these corporations. There are many of varying size, though smaller ones tend to get swallowed up or made irrelevant by their larger competitors in the pursuit of forming a monopoly. The two biggest Guilds of relevance are the Puppet Masters Association, who focus on industry and Puppets, and the Double Helix Guild, who focus on healthcare and providing city services like sewage. Smaller Guilds generally have to cut out a more specific niche to stay relevant, such as the Hunters guild, who specialise in the training and equipment of the monster hunters of their namesake, or the Lodge of Bolts, who manage to provide the cheapest hand crossbows and ammunition in Victrus to pretty much anyone who asks. As there are no restrictions for Guild members to take up positions in government, many Dukes and Royal Advisors serve their Guild first and their people second."
