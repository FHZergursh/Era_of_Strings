    description= _ "New recruits to the Puppet Masters Association are taken on as apprentices to more senior puppeteers, learning the craft from seasoned veterans. Most of their time is spent studying existing designs and performing the maintenance mandatory to keep the wheels of industry turning in Victrus. While not a strict requirement per se, the level of engineering expertise that is expected of a potential apprentice often limits their membership to the higher classes of society, prime targets of any Sweepers aiming to make it big off a ransom payment. Therefor, most apprentices learn how to use their wrenches for more than just maintenance pretty quickly."
