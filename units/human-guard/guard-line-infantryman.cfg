    description= _ "Adult aged men that weren't lucky enough to be taken under the wings of one of the Guilds of Victrus are usually conscripted to the National Guard, making up the bulk of its military. Armed with a musket and bayonet, their training and morale both leaves a lot to be desired, though either way, the importance of the humble Line Infantryman in the National Guard cannot be overstated. Without them, the empire would no doubt crumble. Propaganda is keen to remind all new recruits of this fact."
