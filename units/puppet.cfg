    description= _ "Undoubtedly the most important invention of the last 100 years, Puppets are constructs, most commonly of iron and copper (though this can vary), that handle the task they are designed for and assigned to in place of a human. The Puppet Masters Association is responsible for creating and maintaining almost every puppet in the empire. The cost of Puppets varies almost as much as they do, but the most budget of options are generally well within the budget of the middle class.
<header>text='Characteristics'</header>
Puppets are made up of three major parts that all share, no matter what. The first is the chassis, the external shell and body of the Puppet. The second is the clockwork, the inner cogs, support joints and motors of the Puppet that can move the chassis around and connect to peripherals. The third are the thinking cores, small chips that can be modified and tweaked to give the puppet the ability to process its surroundings, and 'think' in a certain way according to the stimulus given. One should not mistake it for intelligence, it is much more similar to how the instincts of prey animals teach them to run from potential dangers without even needing to witness the bite of a wolf first-hand. Traditional wisdom states that Puppets do not have souls and are not sentient, though this belief has started to be challenged by contemporary scholars."
